# Dijkstra-Algorithm-for-Wikipedia-Pages
________________________________________
In this project, Dijkstra's algorithm is applied to a directed, weighted graph of over 1000 Wikipedia pages where the cost is represented 
as the inverse of their similarity metric calculation. The edges are persistently stored in a text file.

Replication of this program requires the following:
1. Run the Main file to upload a list of Wikipedia pages to a text file.
2. Run the Loader file for similarity calculations, saving the data persistently, and extendible hashing.
3. Run the GUI for testing.
